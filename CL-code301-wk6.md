# CL Code 301 - Week 6
## Week of 1/01/2018

This week focused on functional programming and a deeper exposure to full-stack application development with server-side deployment. It was definitely one of the most challenging weeks with respect to lab assignments, but many important skills were also introduced. We were able to see the power of separating client-side and server-side functionality, and the ability to combine object-oriented programming with template rendering, ajax calls, database table creation/manipulation, and HTTP methods/routes.

### Summary of Skills/Concepts Learned

- functional programming/abstraction
- IIFE (immediately-invoked function expressions)
- .map(), .filter(), .reduce() methods
- production deployment/Heroku
- server-side database creation and communication


### Things to Improve or Learn More About

- additional practice with HTTP methods/CRUD and server routes
- escaping quotes when inserting content into SQL database tables!! *(surround entire content with 'single quotes', replace any sub-quote with two single quotes)
