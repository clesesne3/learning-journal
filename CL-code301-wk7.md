# CL Code 301 - Week 7
## Week of 1/08/2018

In this week, the challenges continued as we focused on building single-page applications, client-side routing, middleware, and state. There were a lot of concepts to digest at once and try to implement within the lab assignments. The overall process is becoming easier to understand, but having to use these concepts in an original assignment (i.e. Project Week) will really make sure I get an even more solid grasp.

### Summary of Skills/Concepts Learned

- separation of concerns (Model-View-Controller) in scripting and CSS styling
- Middleware
- Page.js
- AJAX requests (particularly, PUT/DELETE)

### Things to Improve or Learn More About

- writing 'DRY'er code and simple HTML structure in single-page apps
- details of relationship between client-side and server side functionality (especially with remote connections)
- client-side routing and AJAX calls
