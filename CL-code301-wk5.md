# CL Code 301 - Week 5
## Week of 12/25/2017

The challenge in this week was getting comfortable using SQL, node.js, and PostgreSQL together to build simple, full-stack applications. The success was in gaining a stronger understanding of RESTful HTTP methods, and how data is accessed and displayed between the client-side and server-side. I found that studying the code demos in-depth and trying to clarify what's happening with each HTTP method/SQL query at a fundamental level really helps cement the material and understand the bigger picture.

### Summary of Skills/Concepts Learned

- SQL (simple queries, conditions, joins)
- PostgreSQL (creating databases and tables)
- modifying and deleting records in database tables

### Things to Improve or Learn More About

- SQL queries
- differences between each of the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- connections between CRUD, full-stack process diagram and HTTP methods
