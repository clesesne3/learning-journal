# CL Code 301 - Week 2
## Week of 12/04/2017

This week was fast-paced with a heavier workload, but I'm adjusting well to the class structure and becoming more flexible with respect to the pair-programming labs and exercises. Realizing how important (and beneficial) of a skill it is to be able to work well with individuals of different coding syles and learning pace. It ultimately makes be a better developer, using it as an opportunity to ask questions when I lack understanding or explain concepts clearly when I do understand. Coding in groups where I can bounce my ideas off my classmates or explain a programming concept has been the key to learning quickly so far.
