# CL Code 301 - Week 3
## Week of 12/11/2017

Th challenge of this week was trying to get a solid understanding of AJAX requests and properly retrieving data from a source that is not on our local machine. Group collaboration and pair-programming in labs this week was definitely helpful in getting comfortable with the concepts/methods. The weeks going forward will require more intentional practice and in-depth learning as the concepts/material become even less familiar than before.

#### Summary of Skills/Concepts Learned

- REST
- Form Building (automatic page updating though user entry)
- HTTP, WRRC (Web Request Response Cycle)
- AJAX, JSON requests

### Things to Improve or Learn More About

- MVC (Model-View-Controller) model
- deeper understanding of how data is sent/retrieved on the web
