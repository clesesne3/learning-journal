## Week of 11/27/2017

The first week of Code 301 was challenging and went well. I feel like I will be stretched out of my comfort zone, but not overwhelmed to a point that I can't handle. I feel confident in my development skills coming out of 201, but I will definitely have to mindfully practice coding on a daily basis and challenge myself even more to excel in 301.

I've really been enjoying the Code Wars exercises; it's been a great way to maintain and strengthen my coding skills. It's also helped me learn more efficient and advanced ways to write code by viewing how more experienced developers solve the exercises.
