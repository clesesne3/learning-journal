# CL Code 301 - Week 4
## Week of 12/18/2017

This week involved an introduction to JavaScript from the back-end/server-side perspective through the use of the Node.js framework and the NPM package manager. We learned the basic structure of servers, full-stack applications, and HTTP methods to request and retrieve information. We were also introduced to databases and tables through SQL and PostgreSQL, and how to build tables and access that data on the server side. While these concepts were less familiar and more challenging to understand than our previous modules, I can appreciate the power of server-side routing in building more advanced applications. Getting comfortable with these concepts will definitely require consistent practice and revisiting of the fundamental concepts.

#### Summary of Skills/Concepts Learned

- Node.js
- NPM (Express, PostgreSQL)
- SQL (queries, database table creation/manipulation)

### Things to Improve or Learn More About

- HTTP methods (verbs)
- MVC (Model-View-Controller) model
- advanced/complex SQL query statements
